1
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,060
It was a small town by a small river and a small lake.

2
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,160
In a small northern part
of a Midwest state.

3
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,160
There wasn't so much
wilderness around

4
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,230
that you couldn't
see the town.

5
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,200
On the other hand, there wasn't
so much town around

6
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,160
that you couldn't see and feel
and touch the wilderness.

7
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,360
And the town was full
of fences to walk on

8
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,360
and sidewalks to skate on.

9
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,730
And the muted cries
and laughter of boys and girls.

10
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,760
Full of costumes, dreams
and pumpkin spirits

11
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,460
preparing for the greatest
night of the year.

12
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,100
Better than Easter,
better than Christmas.

13
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,230
Halloween.

14
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,230
'Jenny,
you're gonna raise the dead'

15
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,600
'with all that racket
down there.'

16
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,630
'Just lookingfor another broom, mom.'

17
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,260
'You can alwaysuse the new vacuum cleaner.'

18
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,500
Ha ha, very funny.

19
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,700
Pip is really
gonna love this.

20
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,930
'A little more on my own.
There.That's it.'

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,730
'Oh, yeah,
by the way, dad..'

22
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,700
'Sorry about using
up all your gauze.'

23
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,230
It's okay, Ralph.

24
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,030
I-I just hope no one needs
any first aid, tonight.

25
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,860
Or you have to go to the
bathroom anytime soon.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,930
Gotta go, can't keep
Pip waiting.

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah.Bet it'll even scare Pip.

28
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,460
'Tom Skeleton,
you're one lucky boy.'

29
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,500
A name like Skelton
on this kinda night.

30
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,330
Oh-oh. Oh, Pip's gonna
kill me for being late.

31
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,430
Woo!

32
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,400
'Trick-or-treat.'

33
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,730
Trick-or-treat.

34
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,100
- Yeah.
- Ha ha ha.

35
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,630
- Alright, we made it.
- It's gonna be great.

36
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,300
I'm ready for the treats.

37
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,030
But I get more candy
than you do, Wally.

38
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,900
- You and who else?
- Take that back.

39
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,960
- Come on, Wally.
- Hey, you guys, stop it.

40
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,300
Wait, where's Pip?

41
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,100
He's never been late
for a Halloween

42
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,060
in a million zillion years.

43
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,730
- Bet its some kinda trick.
- Sure it is.

44
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,660
For once, let's surprise him.

45
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,730
Come on.

46
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,860
Pip!

47
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,230
Ah, yes, Joe Pipkin.

48
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,900
Some say, that on
the day he was born

49
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,660
all the soda pop bottles
in the world fizzed over.

50
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,860
Pipkin, who could
yell louder, sing better

51
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,860
and eat more popcorn.

52
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,330
Pip, the greatest boy
who ever lived.

53
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,760
There's his house.

54
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,260
- Huh?
- Impossible.

55
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,330
It can't be.

56
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,600
What?

57
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,360
'Where are the jack-o-lanterns?'

58
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,460
And the corn shocks
on the porch.

59
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,760
'And monsters clinging to the roof.'

60
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,400
Something's wrong,
awfully wrong.

61
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,500
Oh, Pip.

62
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,200
Hey, Tom, look at that.

63
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,160
'Oh, my gosh, it's a note.'

64
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,600
'What's it say?'

65
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,130
"Dear Tom, and all the gang,
didn't mean to spoil

66
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,730
"your Halloween.
Off to the hospital.

67
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,360
Something about appendicitis,
don't worry."

68
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,530
'Signed, Pip.'

69
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,860
Appendicitis?

70
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,560
You can die
from that, right?

71
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,930
"P.S.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,060
Go ahead without me,
I'll catch up. Ready, set, go."

73
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,730
But we can't start
Halloween without Pip.

74
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,130
It wouldn't be official.

75
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,460
There's a shortcut
to the hospital.

76
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,860
No, tha-that shortcut.

77
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,360
Come on, you all heard him.
Ready, set, go!

78
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,460
Think Pip's gonna
be surprised, Tom?

79
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,630
He did say to start
Halloween without him.

80
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,500
It'll be worth it
to see the look on his face.

81
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,230
Woodside, comin' through.

82
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,460
Jenny, wait. Stop. Wait up.

83
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,730
Oh!

84
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,630
There. There's the shortcut.

85
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,230
'Not the ravine.'

86
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,400
Eh, got any other shortcuts
to choose from, Tom?

87
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,700
Ralph does have
a point there.

88
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,600
I think.

89
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,000
What did I tell you? Look.

90
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,060
'It's Pip. Pip!'

91
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,160
Hey, I-I can see
right through him.

92
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,160
Nah, it's just this
funny moonlight.

93
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,300
The important thing is,
he isn't sick.

94
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,960
But what about the hospital?

95
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,930
Don't you get it?
It was a joke all the time.

96
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,660
The ambulance,
that note on the door.

97
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,900
What a trickster. Hey, Pip.

98
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,660
You sure had us fooled!

99
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,560
Where's your Halloween costume?

100
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,630
'Hey, Pip, wait up.'

101
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,560
Not you too, Tom.

102
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,960
Come on, Wally.

103
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,300
The ravine.

104
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,860
The ravine was filled
with varieties of darkness.

105
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,400
Night, shadows, toad eyes
and raven beaks.

106
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,860
The ravine, the birth place
of wild mushrooms.

107
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,200
Pale toadstool, whispers
and ripping's which call

108
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,860
"Come, stay, linger and hide.

109
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,030
"Hide here forever. Never go.

110
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,030
Stay, stay."

111
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,300
Huh?

112
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,060
Woo! Now, you know, I never
believe in haunted houses.

113
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,900
'But that sure look likes
one haunted house to me.'

114
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,730
Ah, yes.

115
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,630
The house looked like it had
been cut of black marble.

116
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,630
With many chimneys, the roof
seemed a vast cemetery.

117
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,730
Each flue signifying
the burial place

118
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,730
of some old forgotten
God of fire.

119
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,200
'This is the best prank he's ever played.'

120
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,230
But it's not fair. He's gonna
trick-or-treat ahead of us.

121
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,530
Yeah, Pip always
gets the most candy.

122
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,030
But that house is haunted.

123
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,860
Darn right, otherwise
why would Pip lead us to it.

124
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,460
Oh, yeah.

125
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,460
'Oh, my gosh.'

126
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,060
This is no time
to hold back, Tom. Remember?

127
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,400
Ready, set, go!

128
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,030
'Why, it's a Marley knocker.'

129
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,400
You know, a Christmas carol,
Scrooge and Marley.

130
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,430
So, who's gonna knock?

131
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,160
You!

132
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,500
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay then, I'll do it.

133
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,600
Oh, great, now you've
done it, Jenny.

134
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,830
'Enter.'

135
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,630
Oh, my gosh.

136
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,860
Tom!

137
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,860
- Ah.
- Ah.

138
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:17,860
- Ooh.
- Ah.

139
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,230
Why have you disrupted me?
And my business?

140
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,760
- I..
- I..

141
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,600
Please, sir. Trick?

142
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,730
Or treat?

143
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,260
Oh, I really have
no time for this.

144
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,260
'But sir,
it's Halloween and--'

145
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,100
So, you've tricked me?
Is that it?

146
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,060
What woulda treat
be then, eh? Hm?

147
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,860
Well, uh, we saw our
friend coming here.

148
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,230
If you let him out,
that'd be a treat.

149
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,130
'Yeah.'

150
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,300
Who are you?

151
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,500
I'm... name's Tom Skeleton.

152
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,460
Know why are your
wearing bones, boy?

153
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,930
Bah, didn't think so.

154
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,860
- And you?
- My friends call me--

155
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,960
Why so dressed upin
an ancient mummies rags? Hm?

156
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,700
Time's up.

157
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,730
And you... the big one.

158
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,230
M-me sir?

159
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,030
Why a monster's face? Hm?

160
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,500
- And what about you, girl?
- Jenny.

161
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,060
Why are you wearing
a costume of a witch? Hm?

162
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,460
No thoughts, eh?

163
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,860
Oh, I'm wasting my breathe.

164
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,060
All dressed up
for All Hallows' Eve.

165
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,130
But you don't know why,
or what or even from where.

166
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,860
- Pity.
- And you, sir?

167
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,400
Eh, who are you?

168
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,630
Oh, yes, of course, hm,
I beg your pardon.

169
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,230
Moundshroud is the name.

170
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,200
'Carapace Clavicle Moundshroud.'

171
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,230
'Is that not
a fine name, children?'

172
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,000
Does it... ring?

173
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,960
But I have work to do, tonight.
No treats... only trick.

174
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,500
So, if you'll excuse me.

175
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,300
'I'm onquite
a tight schedule.'

176
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Huh!

177
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,360
Pip!

178
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,060
- You-you're a ghost.
- 'So, there you are.'

179
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,860
Stop! We still have
our appointment, you and I.

180
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,860
Now, see what you've done.

181
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,360
- 'Pip.'
- 'Pipkin.'

182
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,230
'Woo,
there must be a million of 'em.'

183
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,230
'Pumpkins!'

184
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,460
Look at 'em all.

185
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,360
A pumpkin tree.

186
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,900
'No, a Halloween tree.'

187
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,600
The pumpkins on the tree were not mere pumpkins.

188
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660
Each had a face sliced in it.

189
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,430
Each face was different.

190
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,000
Every nose was a weirder nose.

191
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,730
Every mouth smiled hideously
in some new way.

192
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,330
A thousand grimaces
and twice times

193
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,000
the thousand glares
of fresh cut eyes.

194
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,400
Each blink held
the remnant holiday spirit

195
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,460
of years gone by.

196
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,230
Pipkin, where are you going?

197
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,860
- We're over here.
- Why is he goin' up the tree?

198
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,130
Uh.

199
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,900
'Don't bother.
Now, stay up there.'

200
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,600
Argh.

201
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,230
No, Pip, it's too high.

202
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,230
Come down from there.
What are you..

203
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,960
'Huh! Look!'

204
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,660
'That pumpkin!'

205
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,700
'It looks just like, Pip.'

206
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,060
Argh!

207
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,000
Come on, we gotta help him.

208
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,500
Children, no.

209
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,200
No more interference.

210
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,200
Hold on, Pip, don't move.

211
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,400
You've had your fun, boy.
Don't touch that.

212
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,030
'Got you.'

213
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,500
It belongs to me.
Bring it here.

214
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,530
Inexcusable.
Inexcusable behavior!

215
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,960
- Pip, Pip.
- Over here, Pip.

216
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,200
- Hey, Pipkin.
- Oh, my gosh.

217
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,230
Pip!

218
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,600
- He's melting.
- Where'd he go?

219
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,500
'Help me!'

220
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,960
'Help me!'

221
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,460
No!

222
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,260
Bother, bother,
bother, I say.

223
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,600
'Do you've any idea
what you've done?'

224
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,160
Now, my entire night's
schedule is thrown off.

225
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,930
What'd you do with Pip?
Where did you send him?

226
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,860
Oh, I didn't send him
anywhere, skeleton.

227
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,860
- Where is he?
- Yeah.

228
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,200
Oh, he must not have
liked my company.

229
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,730
So, he escaped.

230
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,330
Escaped, I might add, with
a pumpkin that is my property.

231
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,260
Well then, Cara-Clava..

232
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,860
Clavicle.

233
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,060
But you may call me,
Mr. Moundshroud.

234
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,400
Whatever your name is,
you bring him back right now.

235
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,360
'If only life were that easy.
Hm.'

236
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,630
By now, Pip's escaped
to the undiscovered country.

237
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,730
No telling how long it will
take me to find him again.

238
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,030
Find him?

239
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,630
Can we go with you?
We can help.

240
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,960
Impossible. You've helped quite
enough already. Thank you.

241
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,330
But anything's possible
on Halloween, right?

242
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,900
Ha! What do you know
about Halloween?

243
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,460
'Four meddlers come
barging into my house.'

244
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,130
'Blundering into my business.'

245
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,730
Not even knowing why.

246
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:42,060
You are dressed as a skeleton,
witch, mummy or..

247
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,900
Hm, wait a minute.

248
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,860
It is a long trip.
And it's hours before dawn.

249
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,030
So, I've... we should
have enough time.

250
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,400
If we fly fast enough.

251
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,430
Yes.

252
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,430
And far enough.

253
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes, yes.

254
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,760
We might be able
to catch Pipkin.

255
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,600
Grab his pumpkin fire soul and
have a scavenger huntas well.

256
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,160
'So you can find out who you
are. What you are made off.'

257
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,360
And retrieve your Pipkin
at the same time.

258
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,930
Well, will you come with me?

259
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,560
And solve three
mysteries in one?

260
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,660
Yes!

261
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,500
What fun then.

262
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,730
The undiscovered country it is.

263
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,730
Feast your eyes,
a thousand Halloweens

264
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,660
wait out there
to swallow us whole.

265
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,330
That barn, and on
the sides of the barn

266
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,760
'the makingsof an
October Kite. You see?'

267
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,700
This way, skeleton.
This road, mummy.

268
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,760
'This fence, witch.
This meadow, monster.'

269
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,400
Do you see?

270
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,230
Do you see?

271
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,760
And they did see.

272
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,460
They saw the poster paper
tapestry of circus beasts.

273
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,700
Pasted on the barn side
years ago.

274
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,530
It was as if
the captured animals

275
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,860
were waiting to be released.

276
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,430
- Oh.
- Oh, my gosh.

277
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,760
Oh, my gosh.

278
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,000
Let's build
the kite then, shall we?

279
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,260
Time for you to help.

280
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,560
- Huh.
- Uh.

281
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,060
They seized huge rows of animals

282
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,960
from the weathered walls.

283
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,200
They tore off
patches of fangs.

284
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,530
Scripts of piercing eyes
and sheets of claws and tails.

285
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,360
The unshackled beasts cried.

286
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,700
And assembled in freed
leaps and bounds.

287
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,830
Oh, my gosh!

288
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,760
- Will it fly us?
- I thought you'd never ask!

289
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,430
'It won't fly straight.'

290
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,830
A tail. We need a tail.

291
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,860
Right, boy.

292
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,530
Who else for the tail?

293
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,660
- I'm next.
- Not before me.

294
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,430
- Ah.
- Ah.

295
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,360
Fly.

296
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,860
'Fly.'

297
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,100
Ah, I just remembered
I hate heights.

298
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,760
Two times two is four.
Four times four is sixteen.

299
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,460
Sixteen times sixteen is..

300
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,730
256 is 65500..

301
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,300
It's Pip.

302
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,460
Pip.

303
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,930
Seven hundred and forty.

304
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,300
Pip.

305
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,130
'Pipkin.'

306
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,500
Where's he going?

307
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,460
Not where? When?

308
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,960
Four thousand, Halloweens ago.

309
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,700
Pipkin with my pumpkin
has gone ahead.

310
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,500
Or should I say, passed.

311
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,160
The moon began to blink,
faster and faster

312
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,700
it began to wax to wane.

313
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,360
Until a 1000 times over
it flickered.

314
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,860
And then flickering changed
the landscape below.

315
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,300
'Egypt.'

316
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,860
'But it's brand new.'

317
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,760
'That means we really have
gotten back in time.'

318
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,730
Four thousand years.

319
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,260
Hey.

320
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,430
O-oh, o-oh.

321
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,200
Ar-are those
real life ghosts?

322
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,700
They prefer being
called spirits.

323
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,260
- Tryin' to get into the houses?
- True.

324
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,560
And the food on the porches
is for them?

325
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,860
'Seems so.'

326
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,230
Why, it's good old-fashioned
trick-or-treat.

327
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,930
- Four thousand years ago?
- Yes, imagine that.

328
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,530
Ah, look there.

329
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,960
'That ghost, uh, spirit.'

330
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,530
Sure, let's sneak up on him.

331
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,400
'Pip.'

332
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,660
'Hold on wait.'

333
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,100
'Here we are.'

334
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,430
Enter. Sit. You're welcome.

335
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,530
- Ah.
- Okay.

336
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,460
Ew!

337
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,300
- Ah!
- Uh.

338
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,960
Oh, my gosh.

339
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,260
'Who's that?'

340
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,760
Our great-grandfather.
Don't make a fuss.

341
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,060
'He doesn't look very good.'

342
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,560
Oh, he's been dead
for 67 years.

343
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,200
So, what's he doing here?

344
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,500
Once a year, at the feast
of the ghosts

345
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,560
we invite him out
to sit with us.

346
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,300
Eat.

347
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,200
Don't you wish we had
a custom like this back home?

348
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,700
Dinner for the dead.

349
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,860
Ow!

350
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,300
Oh.

351
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,000
What?

352
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,860
Help!

353
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,860
Well, children. Seems we won't
have time for dessert.

354
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,000
Come on, Mr. Moundshroud,
he's getting too far ahead.

355
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
Huh!

356
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,430
The time is come. Hurry.

357
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,560
Race, run.

358
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,130
Your three mysteries await.

359
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,400
- Wow. Just look at these.
- They're giants.

360
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,300
Pip, didn't go in there, did he?

361
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,860
Yes.

362
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,200
- Oh, great.
- Go ahead, Tom.

363
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,960
- No, Ralph should go first.
- It's all yours, Wally.

364
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,600
No, you first. I insist.

365
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,600
Betcha, Pip sent this
out here to show us the way.

366
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,060
It's got me.

367
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,960
'Hold on.'

368
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,600
'We're coming after you.'

369
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,730
Wait up.

370
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:14,760
You, with the mummy wrappings
and mummy face.

371
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,060
Who? Me?

372
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,030
Day is killed by night.

373
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,600
Summer by winter.

374
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,260
'Osiris the sun God destroyed
by his brother, darkness.'

375
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,160
The seasons.

376
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,660
Is tha-that what the Egyptians
thought of Halloween?

377
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,060
- You tell me.
- Ah.

378
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,860
Why do you wear that costume?

379
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,330
'Oh, you're a mummy, boy.'

380
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,160
'Because that's how Egyptians'

381
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,700
'dressed up their dead
for eternity.'

382
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,200
Spun around
in a cocoon of threads.

383
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,460
They hoped to come forth
like fresh butterflies

384
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,600
in some far dear-loving
underworld.

385
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,430
Know your cocoon, boy.
Touch the strange stuffs.

386
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,630
Then, then every day
was Halloween day then.

387
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,660
Yes, every day, Ralph.
Very good.

388
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,860
But, but what about Pipkin?

389
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,430
It may be too late.

390
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,260
They are wrapping him up
as a gift to eternity, now!

391
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,860
You don't mean like,
right now?

392
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,860
Save them, Ralph.

393
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,560
I'm coming, Pip.

394
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,960
'Ralph.'

395
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,730
Pipkin?

396
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,500
'Ralphy, is that you?'

397
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,300
Yeah, yeah it's me.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

398
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,860
'I'm fading.'

399
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,960
No, you can't leave now.
What about all our plans?

400
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,000
You said someday you'd teach me
how to bat left-handed.

401
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,600
And you're the only friend

402
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,060
who's never made fun
of my wearing glasses.

403
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,760
'Learning to bat left-handed
isn't so hard, Ralphy.'

404
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,400
Oh, great. Now what do I do?

405
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,500
Come along, Pipkin.
You've had your fun.

406
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,460
You and I have an appointment
to keep. You must keep it.

407
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,030
No!

408
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,930
Ah!

409
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,430
The air vents. Come on.

410
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,400
Yes. Find him. Catch him.

411
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,130
Wait up, Ralph.

412
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,760
Hurry, but don't fall.

413
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,660
- Oh, my gosh.
- Wally, don't jinx it, okay?

414
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,360
Oh.

415
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,700
'Pip!'

416
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,160
Hurry back.
Four corners, kids. Grab on.

417
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:42,660
He can hide, but if we hurry,
we can go seek.

418
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,900
Oh!

419
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,930
Oh, my gosh, look down there.

420
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,560
Wally, don't you dare tell
me how high we are.

421
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,660
Time to celebrate, children.

422
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,760
'Happy New Year.'

423
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,860
'No, it's Halloween.'

424
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,630
'Well,
maybe in our time it's All Hallows' Eve.'

425
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,500
'But in this time,
it's New Year's Eve.'

426
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,400
'The true end of summer,
and cold start of winter.'

427
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,060
'Happy New Year.'

428
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,230
Down in the crowd.
Is that him below?

429
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,760
No, he's there above.

430
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,530
What is this place?

431
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,860
Where are we?

432
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,300
When are we?

433
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,860
It's old time, children.
Ancient times. Stonehenge.

434
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,860
You need courage tonight.

435
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,700
It's the Dark Ages,
and this is the longest

436
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,260
darkest night in all dark time.

437
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,930
- Oh, my gosh.
- What? What?

438
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,060
Is that you, Pip?

439
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,860
'In these dark times,
people thought'

440
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,600
'that on this special night'

441
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:50,300
'those who had died during the
year were turned into beasts.'

442
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,860
'Became animals.'

443
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,530
Dogs, wild boars
or worst of all... cats.'

444
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:04,060
'Black as bad luck.
Black as sin.'

445
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,860
Pip?

446
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,530
'Black as night.'

447
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,260
Easy, pip.
Steady, boy.

448
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,630
We-we, we'll save you.

449
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,860
No, I'll get him.

450
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,460
Come here, Pip.

451
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,030
Pip. No, come back.

452
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,700
Tom, I-I think
this is the last year

453
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,600
ever go trick-or-treat
with you guys. Okay?

454
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,660
Peek-a-boo.

455
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,860
There was a hustle of brooms in the broom works.

456
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,730
An immense traffic jams
of brooms for witches

457
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,560
to perch upon.

458
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,500
It was as if all earth's
forests gave up their branches

459
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,700
in one broom and fling.

460
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,860
And scouring autumn fields
cut clean and throttled tight

461
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,360
such cereal grains

462
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:11,930
as made good sweepers,
thrashers, and beaters.

463
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,900
Hey, you know what that is?
A Broom Festival.

464
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,330
And they're making brooms.
But not ordinary brooms.

465
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,860
Touch them.

466
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,700
Feel them.

467
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,930
Broomsticks for witches.

468
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,330
For you.

469
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,860
Me?

470
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,630
Whoops!

471
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,760
Ah.

472
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,000
Ride him, Jenny.

473
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,860
Anyone else care to try it?

474
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,930
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

475
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,030
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.

476
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,630
Jenny, listen to me.

477
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,660
No, I wanna be
back on the ground.

478
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,560
Just put me back
on the ground.

479
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,730
'Where's your spirit of adventure?'

480
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,300
Witches have nothing
to fear from their brooms.

481
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,930
Betcha, it's no different
from riding your bike.

482
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,530
My bike, like my bike.

483
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,000
Hey, you're right.

484
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,860
Now, how about
follow the leader?

485
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,700
Look.

486
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,400
I can't believe it.
While flying, I saw, I saw..

487
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,930
Pip. Was it Pip?

488
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,760
No. Witches. Everywhere.

489
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,430
Of course. It can't
be Halloween without witches.

490
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,460
- Then they really were witches?
- Well, yes and no.

491
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,600
- Could they fly broomsticks?
- Not really.

492
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,030
- They could talk to the dead?
- Nope.

493
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,730
Make hairy warts grow on people?

494
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,030
Sorry, no.

495
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,060
Make people jump
by sticking pins in dolls?

496
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,130
Not to my knowledge.

497
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,930
Well, heck then,
what could they do?

498
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,060
Nothing.

499
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,660
Nothing?

500
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,160
'Ah,
plenty claimed they could.'

501
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,700
But that was just a means
to protect their privacy.

502
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,260
Ever wondered what
the word witch really means?

503
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,760
Well, no. Not until tonight.

504
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,630
Ha ha ha.

505
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,500
Wished that information.

506
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,430
In the Dark Ages anyone with
half a brain, any knowledge

507
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,300
had his wits about him. Yes.

508
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,860
So, anyone too smart
was called..

509
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,060
A witch.

510
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,460
Exactly.

511
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:05,160
And the really smart ones,
ones with the wits called it

512
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,100
Magic. Magic.

513
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,530
In every town,
in every tiny village

514
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,660
the old religions hid out.

515
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:29,400
And all the
little lollygagging cults

516
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,860
all flavors and types
scrambled to survive.

517
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,160
By every crossroad
and by every haystack

518
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,960
dark forms jumped
across flames

519
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,460
as fires burned everywhere.

520
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:49,300
'In the end all Europe was a cloud of witches' smoke.'

521
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,230
Anyone want to be a witch?

522
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,230
No, no, not me.

523
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,460
'Pip!'

524
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,200
Wonderful, let's play tag.

525
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,430
Now, Pip, the pumpkin doesn't
belong to you anymore.

526
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,430
Hold on, Pip.

527
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,600
Grab on.

528
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,900
Hurray. Let's show 'em, Jenny.

529
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,130
Some switch, huh, Jenny?
You saving me, huh?

530
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,730
Don't fall, Pip.

531
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:53,560
What if I need you to talk me
down out of an apple tree again?

532
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,100
Tighter, Pip.
If I ever lost you..

533
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,860
Hey, no tears. Wouldn't you just
hate to have Tom see you cry?

534
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,230
- Yeah. Fun and games are over.
- No, they're not.

535
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,330
Follow me if you can.
Ready, set, go.

536
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,160
There's got to be two zillion,
ten billion acres of air

537
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,400
wrapped round the world.

538
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,260
Which half-acre
is he headed for?

539
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,160
- Now, what?
- I'm still a witch, right?

540
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,630
I got the wits, follow me.

541
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,300
You heard her. Let's go.

542
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,060
There. There he is.

543
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,260
Well, is he here?

544
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:26,930
Gotta be. I can feel him
in my bones.

545
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,860
Where is he, Mr. Moundshroud?

546
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,260
Where, you may ask. Hm.

547
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:33,000
Why, hiding out.

548
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,330
Protecting his pumpkin soul.

549
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,360
How observant of you, skeleton.

550
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:40,260
But to be precise,
it is my pumpkin.

551
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,760
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

552
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,360
I have a riddle
for you, monster.

553
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:03,560
- Can't you ask someone else?
- No, no, it's your turn now.

554
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:06,330
What's bigger and stronger
than demons and witches?

555
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,860
A place so big, it holds back
the night and nightmares?

556
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:12,000
What's bigger
than devils and ghosts?

557
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,200
Bigger?

558
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,230
Bigger?

559
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,530
Ah..

560
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,060
- A cathedrals?
- Well done, monster.

561
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,200
Yes. Places where a running
and renegade child

562
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,230
can hide and take sanctuary.

563
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:33,000
Sanctuary. Sanctuary. Sanctuary.

564
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,100
'Sanctuary.'

565
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,730
- 'Help.'
- Pip.

566
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,060
Ralph, Wally, Jenny.

567
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,330
I think we're getting warmer.

568
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,360
Something wrong,
Mr. Moundshroud?

569
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:02,860
Yeah, you fool
half the night to catch Pip.

570
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,460
So how come you're not
going up to get him?

571
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:09,330
Well, simply because,
there are some places

572
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,030
where I'm not
as welcome as others.

573
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,630
Ah, why don't you
collect Pip for me?

574
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:21,130
Please. Wally.

575
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,860
But how do we reach him?

576
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:30,130
There are ways. After all,
tonight of all nights is still..

577
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,300
- Halloween.
- Precisely.

578
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:36,860
So why not finish building
the cathedral, with your feet?

579
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,730
Are you kidding?

580
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:43,300
No, call the stones
with your feet.

581
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,860
You coming, Mr. Moundshroud?

582
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:52,930
Ha ha ha, you know
I'm always with you.

583
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,230
Carry on.

584
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,130
Come on, guys.
Pip is counting on us.

585
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,630
Leap? Run. They will follow.

586
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:12,860
Oh!

587
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,660
Step lightly.

588
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:26,100
- Sorry, Wally.
- Ah.

589
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,660
- Oh!
- Bravo.

590
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:43,860
They ran on pure,
windy light, only to have bricks, and stones

591
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:47,860
and mortar shuffle like cards,
deal themselves solid

592
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,730
and take form beneath
their toes and heels.

593
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,630
Oh, enough.

594
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:52,660
There, much better, much better.

595
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:06,660
Notre Dame,
I think we've built Notre Dame.

596
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:13,030
- But this can't be Notre Dame.
- Why not?

597
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,100
Can't you see what's missing?

598
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,630
- Monster faces.
- You know, stone devils.

599
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,330
Marble demons.

600
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,660
'Gargoyles.'

601
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,330
Ever wonder why
we like dressing up

602
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,860
as monsters, beasts,
and ornery critters?

603
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:35,000
Monsters remind us
of all the dark nights

604
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,760
'and all fears and nightmares.'

605
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,000
Go ahead, monster. They're
waiting for your summons.

606
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,530
The unemployed of all midnight Europe

607
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,130
shivered in their stone sleep.
And came awake.

608
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,960
All the old beasts,
all the old tales

609
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:12,860
and unused demons put by,
reared at the whistle

610
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:17,630
and in spectral dust devils
of propulsion, arrived.

611
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:51,200
'Monster,
there's your carved stone quarry.'

612
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,300
Gargoyles, now the building
is finished, Tom.

613
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:59,760
'Tom, Jenny, Ralph, Wally,
are you here?'

614
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,560
Where are you, Pip?

615
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:03,660
'Here.'

616
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,130
Oh, my gosh!

617
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:18,030
'Ge-get me, get me out of here.'

618
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,460
- I'm scared.
- It's Gargoyle language?

619
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:24,260
He can talk when the rain
comes out of his mouth.

620
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:26,160
Or the wind blows
over his teeth.

621
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:28,430
Come on,
just a little bit higher.

622
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,360
You can do it.

623
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:34,230
No cutting in line, plenty
for all. One at a time.

624
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,530
Hold it. I'm the only
live Gargoyle here.

625
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,630
- Right, Mr. Moundshroud?
- Indeed.

626
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,600
So, it's up to me.

627
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,600
Tom, right.
Rob, left.

628
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,000
Together now.

629
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,900
Whoa!

630
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,430
Oh, Pipkin,
what's happened to you?

631
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:03,030
- I think I'm dying.
- You are not!

632
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,460
You tried, Wally.
All of you did.

633
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,530
Shut up! Shut up, will you?

634
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,100
Don't quit, keep running,
escape, we'll follow.

635
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,730
- Gotta go now, Wally.
- No, no, Pip, you can't!

636
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,130
Wait, will you?

637
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,230
Remember that time,
those fireworks

638
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,760
I stored in my bedroom.

639
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,330
The one's who started the fire.

640
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,960
Uh, sure smoked up your house.

641
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:28,330
An-and you took
the blame for me.

642
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,100
I never thanked you for that.

643
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,430
Oh!

644
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:36,160
Wally. Come on, two points.
Toss it right up here.

645
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:39,560
- Goodbye, Wally.
- No, Pip, I won't let you go.

646
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,160
No!

647
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:45,130
Ah!

648
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,760
'That's it. Get the pumpkin.'

649
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:50,500
Oh.

650
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:52,560
No.

651
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:55,560
I'm coming, Pip!

652
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,400
Come on, we can't loose him now.

653
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,360
There's no escape.

654
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:24,760
I'll chalk his course
to a final graveyard.

655
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,960
'Well, we've arrived children.'

656
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,400
'Our final destination.'

657
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,900
But where are we?

658
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,560
Listen, guitars!

659
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:06,430
And those must
be skeleton bones.

660
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,130
No, marimbas
and xylophones.

661
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,430
Castanets.

662
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,000
'Hooray!'

663
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,130
That sounds like a bon fire.

664
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,730
'Mexico!'

665
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,330
'Look, all the graveyards!'

666
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,430
'Where are all those
people going?'

667
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,660
El Dia de los Muertos.

668
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,500
The Day of the Dead.

669
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,860
Back home, we'd never think
going to a graveyard

670
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,860
on Halloween.

671
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,700
But this looks like fun!

672
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,500
Yeah! Alright!

673
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,030
'Look at little funerals for sale!'

674
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:14,130
Are those real coffins?

675
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:31,930
- Hey! Look!
- What's this?

676
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,600
Whoa! The newspapers
are full of bones!

677
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,900
Mexican Halloween's
are sure better that ours.

678
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,600
Huh! Pipkin! He must be
around here some place.

679
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,760
Oh... Ah!

680
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:54,900
Oh!

681
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,360
O-oh!

682
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:08,760
Sweet skulls!
Sweet skulls!

683
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:11,860
- Crystal sugar candy skulls!
- Oh! What's going on?

684
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:15,660
'Sweet skulls!
Sweet skulls. Crystal sugar candy skulls.'

685
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,700
'Hey, look at the candy heads.'

686
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,300
Tell me your name,
I give you your skull.

687
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,530
Tom!

688
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,300
How about Ralph?
Ha ha.

689
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,330
- Um, um, Wally!
- Ha ha ha, Jenny!

690
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:43,900
Oh!

691
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,300
Ha ha ha.

692
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,730
Hold them in your palms.

693
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,300
Bite it, swallow it
and survive.

694
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,060
Come out the far black
tunnel of Halloween

695
00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:00,400
and be glad, oh, so glad
you are alive! Ha ha ha.

696
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,560
Hey, we better look for Pip now,
it's getting late.

697
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:14,530
Yes! For All Hallows' Eve
it to be away. Head's up!

698
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,060
Hey! What's goin' on?

699
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:52,200
Whoa! Whoa!

700
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:54,530
- Ooh.
- Ah.

701
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,760
- Ah.
- Ooh.

702
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:03,900
- That was fun.
- What's next?

703
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,430
No more time
for games, children.

704
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,060
The night ends here.

705
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,160
Dow-down in that hole?

706
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:21,330
Down in the catacombs,
he's waiting.

707
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,100
Simon says, "Bring him up."

708
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:35,230
And be extra careful
with my pumpkin.

709
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,100
We'll bring him up but we'll
keep him for ourselves.

710
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,260
Bravery spoken.

711
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,160
Pip would have liked that.

712
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:44,160
Hurry the dawn is approaching.

713
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,930
'Mummy's.'

714
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,130
Their families couldn't pay
the rent on their graves.

715
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,730
So the grave digger
put them down here.

716
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,960
A little too dry for me.

717
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,430
Shh.

718
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:29,960
What're you doing there, Pip?

719
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,560
I have to stay.

720
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,600
I'm trapped.

721
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:37,000
But if you stay there
you'll stay forever.

722
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,730
Tourist will buy tickets
to come look at you.

723
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,060
Pip, come on out it's just us.

724
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:44,100
Huh.

725
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,760
'Oh, my gosh.'

726
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,130
They're alive.

727
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,630
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

728
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,860
Tell me, why do you
wear bones skeleton?

729
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,130
Because of my name.

730
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:04,300
Oh, have you learnt
nothing tonight, boy.

731
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:10,630
Because maybe if we face
death eye ball to eye ball

732
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:14,100
it loses its power
over us, it can't scare us.

733
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,230
Excellent, Tom.

734
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:20,860
So I've got to save, Pip. Alone.

735
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,000
Ah.

736
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,060
'You can do it.'

737
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:30,160
'Don't look back!
Don't look back!'

738
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:32,200
'Just go straight!'

739
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,030
Woo! Woo! Woo!

740
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:50,030
Oh, Pip, don't die.
I'm sorry. So sorry.

741
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,930
What do you mean, Tom?

742
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,200
You came through.

743
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:56,900
No, all this tonight
is my fault.

744
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,230
I once wished for something
to happen to you

745
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,860
so I could be leader
for a change.

746
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:04,130
But I never thought something
like appendicitis.

747
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:09,630
Ah, don't be silly, Tom.
I'll let you lead anytime.

748
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:17,800
Huh? What's happening?

749
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:21,100
Pip! No!

750
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:25,260
Ha ha ha! This truly
has been fun, hasn't it?

751
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:30,000
And I know just where
I'm going to hang this.

752
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,660
No! I got
to him first. I won.

753
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:35,060
Sorry, this never was a contest.

754
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:38,430
It's rent was past due,
it's simple and plain.

755
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,960
- That's not fair.
- You cheated!

756
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:42,760
You said if we came with you
and solve the mysteries

757
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:44,830
of Halloween,
we could save Pipkin.

758
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,800
Children, it's business.

759
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,830
With his illness,
his rent came due

760
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,100
and there was no payment.
He's mine now!

761
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,860
- Well, we tried.
- We did our best.

762
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,200
Let's go home.

763
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:11,300
No! Wait!

764
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,060
Mr. Moundshroud,
I'll make his payment for him.

765
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:17,860
You? What could you possibly
have to pay with?

766
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:19,100
Money?

767
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,930
Currency?

768
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,900
Coin of the realm?

769
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,660
What if uh..

770
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:27,700
'What if what, boy?'

771
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:32,430
Well, what if I gave you, uh,
something of value.

772
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,030
Say, A year of my life.

773
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,600
Oh!

774
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:39,130
You'd do that for him?

775
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,900
Yes. A year from
the end of my life.

776
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,730
It's yours if it would save Pip.

777
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:47,200
One precious year from the
far burned out candle end

778
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,930
of your life, eh?

779
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,460
Think before you answer!

780
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:53,030
You won't miss it now,
but 60 years from today

781
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:57,700
to 72 or 80 when I come
for payment, you may regret it.

782
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:05,900
Is he worth it,
this friend of yours, hm?

783
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,930
More than you'll ever know.

784
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:13,860
Hm. One boy's love.

785
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,600
'Take one of mine too.'

786
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,900
- And mine.
- I'm in.

787
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,130
Four for one makes
good business, doesn't it?

788
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:31,430
Yes! I like it!

789
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:35,100
Here then!

790
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:39,100
Chew, swallow,
swallow and chew.

791
01:02:58,660 --> 01:02:59,760
- Pip!
- Wait!

792
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:00,860
Come back!

793
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:01,860
Where's he going?

794
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:04,860
After all this,
only one place.

795
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,200
Home!

796
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:08,130
But we saved him, didn't we?

797
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,100
Will he live, Mr. Moundshroud?

798
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,630
Come! Our night journey is over!

799
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,660
One last game
of musical chairs!

800
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:20,130
Moundshroud sprung about like a whirlwind.

801
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,200
His arms flung out,
cut the air in slicing

802
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,730
grabs and swoops

803
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:28,000
that shook the mummies
in earthquakes of bones.

804
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:30,730
Fall down,
whistled the whirlwind.

805
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:33,630
Fall up, was the echo.

806
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:46,560
They tumbled through the sky
like a self made storm.

807
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:49,960
It was the end of their
4000 year flight.

808
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:51,900
From Egyptian crypts.

809
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,030
To English broom fields.

810
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,300
To French quarry works.

811
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,300
To Mexican bone yards.

812
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:17,200
They swooped homeward.

813
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,160
Once around the court house.

814
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:22,060
And twice around the pumpkin
burning tree.

815
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:25,430
And a final time
around old Moundshroud's house.

816
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,700
Where dust sifted out windows
to greet them.

817
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,430
And that children
is Halloween!

818
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,160
All rolled up in one.

819
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:51,160
Night and day.
Summer and winter.

820
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:52,530
Life and death.

821
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:57,230
Four thousand years ago,
100 years or this year.

822
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,930
'One place or another.'

823
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,060
'The celebrations
are all the same.'

824
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:04,200
El Dia de los Muertos.

825
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:05,230
Day of the Dead.

826
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,530
Feast of ghosts.

827
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,230
All Hallows' Eve.

828
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,900
Halloween!

829
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:14,230
I thank you for a most
amusing and profitable evening.

830
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:16,430
And after what you've done
for your friend.

831
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,100
One I will never forget.

832
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,030
- But what about--
- Run!

833
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,930
See for yourselves!

834
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,260
The last grand trick-or-treat!

835
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:13,200
'Look! It's his pumpkin.'

836
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,030
'Oh, my gosh! He must be okay.'

837
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:25,300
Hi, guys.

838
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,900
- Pipkin!
- You are alive!

839
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,530
Hooray!

840
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,030
They took my appendix out.

841
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:34,130
For a while,
I thought I was a goner.

842
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,430
Imagine that.

843
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:46,460
Anyway, thanks for... everything.

844
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:49,900
Huh? What are you talking about?
We didn't do anything.

845
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,400
- Nothing.
- Heck.

846
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:53,030
Gosh.

847
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,560
Is that so?

848
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:59,930
Well, I had dreams
about Pyramids, Stonehenge

849
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,330
Paris and Mexico.

850
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,700
Like I said, thanks.

851
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,860
Then a great, wondrous, happy,
tiredness gathered

852
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:13,330
in their eyelids
and arms and feet.

853
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,630
The witch and mummy
and monster and skeleton

854
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:21,000
ran back to their own houses
to remember this special night

855
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:24,700
that they would never in all
their lives, ever forget.

856
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:37,260
Old Moundshroud blew out
one last candle.

857
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:39,960
Causing it to
flicker and flare.

858
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:42,930
The wind blew in and out
the fresh cut mouth

859
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,900
with the whispered song.

860
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,130
A 1000 pumpkins were seized
and blown into the sky.

861
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,300
That is all but one pumpkin.

862
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,900
Pip's pumpkin.

863
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,300
Pip's spirit and soul.

864
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:00,500
That was traded for and saved
on that Halloween night

865
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,630
So long ago.
