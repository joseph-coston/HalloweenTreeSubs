# About

This is an attempt at a Japanese/English bilingual translation of the subtitles for the animated film _The Halloween Tree_ adapted from Ray Bradbury's novel of the same name.
The objective is to produce something passible enough for use in the classroom as an entertaining exercise in foreign language and culture exposure that children of school grades 5-9 might enjoy.The initial attempt was made using tools such as Google Translate, DeepL, and online dictionaries like jisho.org.Â
